# SmartDoorLock
This project turns any deadbolt door lock into an electronic IOT lock by using an NodeMCU ESP8266 and a servo. The lock is connected to the internet through Blynk and can be controlled through a phone app, NFC tag in combination with IOS shortcuts/ Android Tasker, and a physical button.
